Open data is an approach that aims to make digital data accessible and usable for everyone.

For communities and public bodies, open data involves publishing data on an open platform. They publish statistics, maps, schedules, economic data, and financial data about their region.

Governments are required by law to release public data. A legal framework defines which information can be made public and which information can't. Personal information are excluded from the open data approach. (This could be phrased differently.)

Open data can become a reliable information source for researchers, journalists and citizens.

Open data paves the way to the creation of useful software. For example, the city publishes some data on the internet: bus schedules, geolocations of bus stops and [something about the sidewalk]. Developers can freely reuse the data to make phone apps that help people with disabilities access public transit.

Open data makes it possible for businesses to develop new, innovative services.

Open data makes public action accessible and comprehensible: projects, decisions, public accounts. It facilitates citizen engagement.

Finally, open data shines some light on improvements in public services by making them visible, accessible (and reactive???). We're not in the 20th century anymore.
