Open data is an approach that aims to make digital data accessible and usable for everyone.

For communities and public bodies, open data involves publishing data on an open platform. They publish statistics, maps, schedules, economic data, and financial data about their region.

Governments are required by law to release public data. A legal framework defines which information can be made public and which information can't. Personal information are excluded from the open data approach.

Open data can become a reliable information source for researchers, journalists and citizens.

Open data paves the way to the creation of useful software. For example, the city publishes some data on the internet: bus schedules, locations of bus stops and sidewalk heights. Developers can freely reuse the data to make phone apps that help people with disabilities access public transit.

Open data makes it possible for businesses to develop new, innovative products and services.

Open data makes government accessible and comprehensible. Governments publish data about projects, decisions, and public accounts, and this facilitates citizen engagement.

Finally, open data changes our perspective on government services by making them visible and accessible. We're not in the 20th century anymore.

Everyone wins when we open up data.
